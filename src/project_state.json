Add a Hint button that shows tips for stuck players, and a fail-safe system that after 2 failed attempts on the same level presents 3 multiple-choice options including the correct answer. Adjust creator-name placement by removing it from its current location and placing it under the “Choose your challenge” section. Continue expanding with new, more futuristic/AI-flavored and more realistic challenges and additional levels, while remaining an Internet Computer dapp (React frontend + Motoko backend) with an on-chain global leaderboard.
